# Emotion Detection Web App (IBM Coursera Final Project)

This is my final project for the Coursera course:
**"Developing AI Applications with Python and Flask" by IBM**
✅ Completed with a score of 97.5%

---

## 📌 Project Summary
A Flask-based web app that takes a sentence as input and returns emotion scores for:
- Joy
- Anger
- Sadness
- Fear
- Disgust

It also highlights the dominant emotion.

---

## ⚠️ Important Note
- The app originally uses an IBM-hosted Skills Network API for emotion detection.
- This API is only accessible within the IBM Skills Network Cloud IDE.
- Therefore, running this app locally (on your PC) will not work as intended.

---

## 🧪 Optional Offline Mode
For testing purposes only:
- Replace the API logic in `emotion_detection.py` with `text2emotion`
- Install: `pip install text2emotion`

---

## 📎 Purpose
This repository is meant as a completed project submission.
⛔ It is not intended for further development or deployment.
